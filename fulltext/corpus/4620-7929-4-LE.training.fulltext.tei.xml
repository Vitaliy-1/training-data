		<p>Decompressive craniectomy (DC) refers to the
			<lb/>
			removal of an area of skull in order to enhance
			<lb/>
			the potential volume of the intracranial
			<lb/>
			compartment. It was first described by Kocher
			<lb/>
			in the treatment of post-traumatic brain
			<lb/>
			oedema which was refractory to conventional
			<lb/>
			medical treatment in 1901 <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Since then,
			<lb/>
			interest in the procedure has either increased
			<lb/>
			or decreased at various times. At present,
			<lb/>
			however, it is commonly accepted as a means
			<lb/>
			of rapidly relieving intracranial hypertension
			<lb/>
			associated with a number of clinical conditions.
			<lb/>
			The procedure however remains controversial
			<lb/>
			owing to unresolved issues <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Despite the renewed interest in DC during the
			<lb/>
			last decade, there are as yet no clear-cut
			<lb/>
			guidelines regarding the indications for, or
			<lb/>
			optimal timing of the procedure <ref type="biblio">[3,4]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>In this paper, we briefly review aspects of DC
			<lb/>
			including: its documented benefits, the
			<lb/>
			outcome determinants and the associated
			<lb/>
			complications using the following search
			<lb/>
			terms: &quot;decompressive craniectomy&quot;,
			<lb/>
			&quot;outcome of&quot;, &quot;complications of&quot;, &quot;indications
			<lb/>
			for&quot;, &quot;infarction&quot;, &quot;brain injury&quot; and
			<lb/>
			&quot;cranioplasty&quot;.

		<head>CEREBRAL OEDEMA AND INTRACRANIAL
			<lb/>
			HYPERTENSION
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Cerebral oedema and intracranial
			<lb/>
			hypertension are among the most fundamental
			<lb/>
			pathophysiological processes occurring in
			<lb/>
			several neurologic conditions including:
			<lb/>
			subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), traumatic
			<lb/>
			brain injury (TBI), cerebral infarction, cerebral
			<lb/>
			blood flow abnormalities, inadequate oxygen
			<lb/>
			delivery and energy failure. The impaired
			<lb/>
			cerebral perfusion resulting from the increased
			<lb/>
			pressure precipitates further increases and
			<lb/>
			accounts for the vicious cycle leading to cell
			<lb/>
			injury and death. A major goal in the treatment
			<lb/>
			of these patients is, therefore, the interruption
			<lb/>
			of the vicious cycle by controlling the brain
			<lb/>
			swelling and maintaining the intracranial
			<lb/>
			pressure (ICP) below target. Failure to
			<lb/>
			interrupt this cycle is thought to be a significant
			<lb/>
			contributor to poor outcome in the patients -<lb/>many of whom will either die or survive with
			<lb/>
			severe disability (with mortality exceeding 80%
			<lb/>
			being reported in some series) <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Several modes of intervention have been
			<lb/>
			applied in cases of intracranial hypertension.
			<lb/>
			Most of them are effective and include
			<lb/>
			therapies like the use of osmotic diuretics
			<lb/>
			(such as mannitol or hypertonic saline),
			<lb/>
			sedation, high-dose barbiturates, mild
			<lb/>
			hyperventilation, moderate hypothermia,
			<lb/>
			maintenance of oxygenation and drainage of
			<lb/>
			cerebrospinal fluid by ventriculostomy <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			Clinical evidence, however, shows that these
			<lb/>
			measures are not always effective, and as a
			<lb/>
			result the vicious cycle continues to propagate.
			<lb/>
			In such situations, more aggressive methods
			<lb/>
			of treatment are indicated. Furthermore, some
			<lb/>
			of the conventional measures have been
			<lb/>
			associated with significant side effects. For
			<lb/>
			example, whereas mannitol is known to cause
			<lb/>
			adverse effects like pulmonary congestion,
			<lb/>
			convulsions, rebound intracranial
			<lb/>
			hypertension, paradoxical increase in
			<lb/>
			intracranial pressure <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> as well as fluid and
			<lb/>
			electrolyte disorders; barbiturates have been
			<lb/>
			reported to cause hypotension and depressed
			<lb/>
			cardiac function while rebound increase in
			<lb/>
			intracranial pressure has been known to occur
			<lb/>
			following hyperventilation.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Decompressive craniectomy is thought to be a
			<lb/>
			potential option in these instances <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, with the
			<lb/>
			decision to intervene preferably being based
			<lb/>
			on invasive monitoring of the intracranial
			<lb/>
			pressure <ref type="biblio">[6,7]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>
			DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>
			Surgical decompression as a means of
			<lb/>
			relieving intracranial pressure is an old
			<lb/>
			neurosurgical concept <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Mainly, it involves
			<lb/>
			raising a bone flap, duraplasty, cerebrospinal
			<lb/>
			fluid drainage and removal of any intracranial
			<lb/>
			mass lesions. The modern concept of
			<lb/>
			decompression for traumatic brain injury (TBI)
			<lb/>
			was introduced by Harvey Cushing in the early
			<lb/>
			twentieth century <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. Decompressive
			<lb/>
			craniectomy (DC) refers to the removal of an
			<lb/>
			area of skull bone with the aim of converting
			<lb/>
			the &apos;closed&apos; intracranial compartment into an
			<lb/> &apos;open&apos; one.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Interest in the procedure has fluctuated
			<lb/>
			through the years partly due to a number of
			<lb/>
			unresolved issues including: whether the
			<lb/>
			results justify the treatment as well as the
			<lb/>
			associated complications (such as the
			<lb/>
			increased tendency of brain injury to occur at
			<lb/>
			the craniectomy site) <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. There has also been
			<lb/>
			concern about the functional outcome in
			<lb/>
			surviving patients. Nevertheless, there has
			<lb/>
			been a revival of interest during the last couple
			<lb/>
			of decades; and it has come to gain wide
			<lb/>
			acceptance as a salvage procedure in the
			<lb/>
			treatment of refractory intracranial
			<lb/>
			hypertension in a number of clinical conditions
			<lb/>
			which are accompanied by massive oedema
			<lb/>
			and brain swelling <ref type="biblio">[10-12]</ref>. The adverse effects
			<lb/>
			of intracranial hypertension are due to
			<lb/>
			compression of the brain as well as
			<lb/>
			impairment of cerebral blood flow.
			<lb/>
			Decompressive craniectomy reduces this
			<lb/>
			pressure and enhances blood flow; and it has
			<lb/>
			been shown that the larger the craniectomy,
			<lb/>
			the greater the reduction of the ICP [L, T].
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Clinical data show that DC is a safe and
			<lb/>
			effective primary surgical procedure. Its role in
			<lb/>
			the treatment of patients with intracranial
			<lb/>
			hypertension associated with post-traumatic
			<lb/>
			brain swelling is, however, still controversial
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">[3,12]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Even though the optimum size of the
			<lb/>
			craniectomy is still a subject of controversy,
			<lb/>
			clinical evidence shows that sub-optimal bone
			<lb/>
			windows increase the chances of brain injury
			<lb/>
			and thereby contribute to poor outcome. A
			<lb/>
			craniectomy of at least 12cm is recommended
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">[I]</ref>. However, the size of the bone flap should
			<lb/>
			be tailored to meet the individual need. In their
			<lb/>
			retrospective study of 263 patients with severe
			<lb/>
			traumatic brain injury that were treated with
			<lb/>
			large decompressive craniectomy (135
			<lb/>
			patients) or routine decompressive
			<lb/>
			craniectomy (128 patients), Li et al compared
			<lb/>
			the treatment outcome and postoperative
			<lb/>
			complications of the two treatment methods
			<lb/>
			during a 6-month follow-up period. They found
			<lb/>
			that whereas large decompressive
			<lb/>
			craniectomy is superior to routine
			<lb/>
			decompressive craniectomy in improving the
			<lb/>
			outcome of severe TBI and effectively
			<lb/>
			reducing the chances of reoperation, it is also
			<lb/>
			associated with a higher incidence of delayed
			<lb/>
			complications such as intracranial haematoma
			<lb/>
			and contralateral subdural effusion [L].
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Other controversial aspects of DC include: the
			<lb/>
			functional outcome following the procedure as
			<lb/>
			it relates to patient selection criteria as well as
			<lb/>
			surgical timing; its benefits in the treatment of
			<lb/>
			patients with massive infarction of the territory
			<lb/>
			of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">[S]</ref>; whether the craniectomy should be
			<lb/>
			unilateral or bilateral; and whether or not
			<lb/>
			durotomy or duraplasty should be performed
			<lb/>
			[R, U].
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Despite the controversies, several studies
			<lb/>
			have documented beneficial effects due to its
			<lb/>
			performance. The advantages DC has over
			<lb/>
			more conservative approaches to ICP control
			<lb/>
			are thought to be due to the rapid and
			<lb/>
			generally permanent decline in ICP,
			<lb/>
			maintenance of neurologic status and the
			<lb/>
			ability to obtain a neurologic examination after
			<lb/>
			it is performed <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. Some studies have found
			<lb/>
			that decompressive craniectomy also improves
			<lb/>
			cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood
			<lb/>
			flow in head injured patients <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Clinical data also indicate that DC reduces
			<lb/>
			mortality, improves functional recovery,
			<lb/>
			reduces duration of stay in intensive care unit
			<lb/>
			and improves the Barthel Index Score,
			<lb/>
			especially when it is performed early <ref type="biblio">[3,19-30]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			Guerra et al reported that up to 65% of their
			<lb/>
			patients who underwent DC for diffuse brain
			<lb/>
			swelling refractory to medical management
			<lb/>
			made a good recovery at 1 year <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. In
			<lb/>
			experimental models of TBI and ischaemic
			<lb/>
			stroke, it has been demonstrated that DC
			<lb/>
			minimises post-traumatic ICP increase,
			<lb/>
			improves cerebral perfusion, significantly
			<lb/>
			reduces secondary brain damage and
			<lb/>
			improves survival and functional outcome.
			<lb/>
			These effects are thought to be the result of
			<lb/>
			increases in collateral circulation, reductions in
			<lb/>
			tissue oedema and improvements in
			<lb/>
			oxygenation and energy metabolism in injured
			<lb/>
			tissues <ref type="biblio">[9,31]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Children: Studies have shown that the
			<lb/>
			majority of severely brain injured children in
			<lb/>
			whom early DC was performed benefited from
			<lb/>
			the procedure as demonstrated by the prompt
			<lb/>
			control of the intracranial pressure,
			<lb/>
			improvement in radiological findings and good
			<lb/>
			neurological recovery. It is suggested that the
			<lb/>
			procedure has advantage over non-surgical
			<lb/>
			methods of treatment amongst children
			<ref type="biblio">[32-<lb/>35]
			</ref>
			.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>INDICATIONS
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>In spite of the fact that there are numerous
			<lb/>
			reports in the literature supporting good clinical
			<lb/>
			outcome after decompressive craniectomy,
			<lb/>
			there are no clearly defined indications for, or
			<lb/>
			optimal timing of the procedure <ref type="biblio">[3,4,9]</ref>. DC has
			<lb/>
			most commonly been performed in patients
			<lb/>
			with traumatic brain injury <ref type="biblio">[5,36]</ref> and cerebral
			<lb/>
			infarction <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref> associated with intractable
			<lb/>
			intracranial hypertension. Other indications,
			<lb/>
			which have mostly been described in single
			<lb/>
			case reports or small case series, include
			<lb/>
			meningitis <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>, subdural empyema,
			<lb/>
			encephalitis <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>, acute disseminated
			<lb/>
			encephalomyelitis <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>, encephalopathy due to
			<lb/>
			Reye syndrome <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>, toxoplasmosis <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref> and
			<lb/>
			cerebral venous and dural sinus thrombosis
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">[43]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Various workers have based their decision to
			<lb/>
			operate on different premises. Reddy et al, for
			<lb/>
			example, based their decision to perform DC
			<lb/>
			on the presence of mass effect with midline
			<lb/>
			shift on neuroimaging and the impairment of
			<lb/>
			consciousness to GCS of 12 and below <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			Albanèse et al, on the other hand, performed
			<lb/>
			early DC (within 24 hours) among their head
			<lb/>
			injured patients, if they had a GCS score of
			<lb/>
			less than 6 and showed clinical signs of
			<lb/>
			cerebral herniation (which were correlated with
			<lb/>
			abnormalities on computed tomography scan -<lb/>such as the presence of haematoma or brain
			<lb/>
			swelling). Similarly, they used as indications
			<lb/>
			for &apos;late&apos; decompression (i.e. more than 24
			<lb/>
			hours) an intractable intracranial hypertension
			<lb/>
			-with intracranial pressure of above 35 mm
			<lb/>
			Hg, absence of pupillary reflexes and CT
			<lb/>
			abnormalities <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>
			OUTCOME DETERMINANTS
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Clinical data show that outcome in many of the
			<lb/>
			survivors of decompressive craniectomy is
			<lb/>
			acceptable <ref type="biblio">[44-47]</ref>. Using the Glasgow
			<lb/>
			Outcome Score Extended (GOSE), functional
			<lb/>
			outcome was generally adjudged as good in
			<lb/>
			several studies. Evidence from some of these
			<lb/>
			studies indicates that one of the most
			<lb/>
			important determinants of outcome is the
			<lb/>
			timing of the procedure: with good outcome
			<lb/>
			correlating with early surgery (generally within
			<lb/>
			48 hours). Younger patients generally fare
			<lb/>
			better, with age greater than 50 years being
			<lb/>
			associated with a poorer outcome. Glasgow
			<lb/>
			Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 and above is
			<lb/>
			associated with favourable outcome, while
			<lb/>
			mortality rates and the incidence of residual
			<lb/>
			disabilities are much higher in patients with
			<lb/>
			admission GCS of 5 and below <ref type="biblio">[3,5,48,49]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Other factors that have been associated with
			<lb/>
			poor outcome include: polytrauma and
			<lb/>
			significant pupillary abnormalities (anisocoria
			<lb/>
			or mydriasis). It is, however, believed that of all
			<lb/>
			these factors, the only one that is statistically
			<lb/>
			related to bad prognosis is GCS at the time of
			<lb/>
			admission.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>PITFALLS AND COMPLICATIONS
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Despite the documented benefits of
			<lb/>
			decompressive craniectony, a number of
			<lb/>
			workers have expressed concern as to
			<lb/>
			whether the procedure has always been
			<lb/>
			performed only on patients that actually
			<lb/>
			needed it, or whether it has also been
			<lb/>
			performed in cases that probably would have
			<lb/>
			benefited from medical treatment alone. This is
			<lb/>
			pertinent in view of the fact that the risk of
			<lb/>
			complications following the procedure is
			<lb/>
			comparatively high, with some studies
			<lb/>
			reporting as much as 50% complication rate
			<lb/>
			postoperatively <ref type="biblio">[50]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<figure type="table">Table
			1: Decompressive craniectomy following brain injury: factors and considerations in patient
			<lb/>
			selection that have been found to be important to patient outcome.
			<lb/>
			1. Failed pharmacotherapeutic
			<lb/>
			intervention
			<lb/>
			Sustained intracranial hyper-tension which does not
			<lb/>
			respond to conservative strategies carries a bad prognosis,
			<lb/>
			with mortality exceeding 80% being reported in some
			<lb/>
			series. Decompressive craniectomy is often performed as a
			<lb/>
			final option in the treatment of such cases <ref type="biblio">[1,5]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			2. Timing
			<lb/>
			Early decompressive craniectomy (within 48 hours of
			<lb/>
			injury) has been associated with good functional outcome.
			<lb/>
			Reports
			<lb/>
			indicate
			<lb/>
			that
			<lb/>
			neurological
			<lb/>
			recovery
			<lb/>
			is
			<lb/>
			comparatively inferior among patients in whom surgery was
			<lb/>
			delayed
			<ref type="biblio">[26,61].
				<lb/>
			</ref>
			3. Brain herniation
			<lb/>
			DC should be performed before the development of
			<lb/>
			neurological features of brain herniation. Evaluation of the
			<lb/>
			functional recovery of patients, using the Glasgow
			<lb/>
			Outcome Scale and Barthel Index, showed that patients
			<lb/>
			who underwent DC before the occurrence of brain
			<lb/>
			herniation had comparatively more satisfactory outcome
			<lb/>
			than those in whom the procedure was performed after
			<lb/>
			onset of herniation <ref type="biblio">[62,63]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			4. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
			<lb/>
			score
			<lb/>
			Score should be at least 8. Lower GCS scores appear to
			<lb/>
			be associated with a poorer outcome. Studies indicate that
			<lb/>
			most of the mortalities were among patients that had GCS
			<lb/>
			of 4 to 6 at the time of craniectomy; whereas the
			<lb/>
			overwhelming majority of the survivors were those who had
			<lb/>
			higher GCS scores (8 and above). Reddy et al reported
			<lb/>
			88% survival among their patients who had a preoperative
			<lb/>
			GCS of 8 and above, and 27% survival among those with
			<lb/>
			GCS less than 8 [3,5,18,58].
			<lb/>
			5. Patient&apos;s age
			<lb/>
			Should be less than 50 years. Age is perhaps one of the
			<lb/>
			key factors in taking the decision whether or not to perform
			<lb/>
			DC. Patients in younger age groups tend to do better after
			<lb/>
			surgery, with age greater than 50 years being associated
			<lb/>
			with a poorer outcome. The incidence of complications is
			<lb/>
			also higher above this age <ref type="biblio">[1,18,32,58,64,66</ref>].
			<lb/>
			6. Primary brainstem injury
			<lb/>
			There should be no primary brainstem injury. The chances
			<lb/>
			of survival following DC in patients with primary brainstem
			<lb/>
			injury are greatly reduced and as such several authors
			<lb/>
			consider this a contraindication to this form of intervention
			<lb/>
			[1,66].
			<lb/>
			7. Abnormal pupillary findings.
			<lb/>
			Clinical data show that recurrent or persistent absence of
			<lb/>
			pupil reflexes indicates a poor neurological outcome <ref type="biblio">[5,18]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			8. Intracranial pressure
			<lb/>
			Should preferably be less than 40 mm Hg at the time of
			<lb/>
			decompression. Clinical data show that patients with
			<lb/>
			sustained ICP of more than 40 mm Hg did comparatively
			<lb/>
			poorly after DC as compared to those whose ICP was
			<lb/>
			lower at the time of surgery <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			9. Midline shift
			<lb/>
			The degree of midline shift in the initial computed
			<lb/>
			tomography has been found to correlate well with the
			<lb/>
			quality of outcome following DC. Preoperative midline shift
			<lb/>
			greater than 1 cm is believed to be a significant predictor of
			<lb/>
			poor outcome <ref type="biblio">[18,65]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</figure>
		
		<p>A very important drawback of DC is the
			<lb/>
			increased risk of brain injury. Honeybul reports
			<lb/>
			the case of a middle aged man who had a DC
			<lb/>
			following TBI as a result of a fall. The patient
			<lb/>
			was reported to be making good recovery
			<lb/>
			when he fell a second time and injured the
			<lb/>
			unprotected craniectomy site. As a result, he
			<lb/>
			suffered further cerebral injury and
			<lb/>
			subsequently died <ref type="biblio">[51]</ref>. The case highlights
			<lb/>
			the need to view these patients as particularly
			<lb/>
			high risk and emphasises the importance of
			<lb/>
			measures aimed at protecting the brain after
			<lb/>
			the procedure.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The fact that a minimum of two surgical
			<lb/>
			procedures are required -the first being the
			<lb/>
			actual removal of the bone flap and the second
			<lb/>
			to repair the defect (cranioplasty) -is also a
			<lb/>
			potential cause of concern <ref type="biblio">[8,52]</ref> since the
			<lb/>
			latter has also been associated with a number
			<lb/>
			of complications.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>A major specific complication that has been
			<lb/>
			associated with DC is the syndrome of sinking
			<lb/>
			skin flap described by Yamaura and Makino. It
			<lb/>
			is characterised by progressive neurological
			<lb/>
			deterioration with the depression of the skin at
			<lb/>
			the site of the cranial defect, and develops
			<lb/>
			within a few weeks to several months after
			<lb/>
			large external cerebral decompression. These
			<lb/>
			authors opine that the neurological
			<lb/>
			deterioration may be due solely to the effect of
			<lb/>
			the concavity of the skin flap with consequent
			<lb/>
			distortion of the underlying brain which is
			<lb/>
			subjected to the atmospheric pressure through
			<lb/>
			it <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Other reported complications of DC include:
			<lb/>
			contralateral subdural effusions <ref type="biblio">[53]</ref>, infections
			<lb/>
			(such as meningitis or brain abscess) and
			<lb/>
			hydrocephalus <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. Persistent vegetative state
			<lb/>
			is probably one of the most devastating
			<lb/>
			outcomes following decompressive
			<lb/>
			craniectomy <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref>. It is thus necessary that in
			<lb/>
			taking the decision to operate, the risk of
			<lb/>
			complications should be weighed against the
			<lb/>
			potential benefits of the procedure in the
			<lb/>
			context of the life-threatening circumstances.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Cranioplasty, which is commonly indicated for
			<lb/>
			large cranial defects following DC, is also
			<lb/>
			associated with several complications
			<lb/>
			including extradural haematoma, infections
			<lb/>
			and instability of the implant <ref type="biblio">[52,55,56]</ref>, among
			<lb/>
			others. Cranioplasty is generally performed 3
			<lb/>
			months after the decompressive craniectomy.
			<lb/>
			Clinical data, however, reveal that the rate of
			<lb/>
			complications is reduced when it is performed
			<lb/>
			early. Thus, there is at present, a tendency to
			<lb/>
			perform it within 5 to 8 weeks of the
			<lb/>
			craniectomy <ref type="biblio">[57]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>
			ONGOING TRIALS
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>There are at present two prospective
			<lb/>
			randomised controlled trials aimed at providing
			<lb/>
			Class I evidence on the role of DC in the
			<lb/>
			treatment of intracranial hypertension following
			<lb/>
			severe TBI. The DECRA Trial
			<lb/>
			(DECompressive CRAniectomy Trial) is a
			<lb/>
			multi-centre prospective randomised trial
			<lb/>
			designed to evaluate the effect of early
			<lb/>
			decompressive craniectomy on neurological
			<lb/>
			function in patients with severe TBI. It is based
			<lb/>
			on the theory that early decompressive
			<lb/>
			craniectomy can improve long term
			<lb/>
			neurological outcome in patients with severe
			<lb/>
			traumatic brain injury and intracranial
			<lb/>
			hypertension which is refractory to
			<lb/>
			conventional management <ref type="biblio">[58]</ref>. RESCUEicp
			<lb/>
			(Randomised Evaluation of Surgery with
			<lb/>
			Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of
			<lb/>
			intracranial pressure) is another prospective,
			<lb/>
			randomised international multi-centre trial
			<lb/>
			aimed at providing class 1 evidence as to
			<lb/>
			whether DC is effective for the management of
			<lb/>
			patients with refractory intra-cranial
			<lb/>
			hypertension following TBI as compared with
			<lb/>
			medical management alone <ref type="biblio">[59]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>A major limitation of this review is that
			<lb/>
			standard data meta-analysis techniques could
			<lb/>
			not be applied; and like several other
			<lb/>
			publications on decompressive craniectomy in
			<lb/>
			the literature, it tended to be biased in favour
			<lb/>
			of publications with good outcome. There was
			<lb/>
			nonuniformity in several aspects of the studies
			<lb/>
			evaluated, many of which were based on
			<lb/>
			uncontrolled retrospective data and small case
			<lb/>
			series. Some of the areas of variation in the
			<lb/>
			reports were the differences in detail in the
			<lb/>
			surgical procedures performed as well as their
			<lb/>
			indications: e.g., the choice of
			<lb/>
			hemicraniectomy instead of bilateral
			<lb/>
			craniectomy, durotomy or duraplasty, Glasgow
			<lb/>
			Coma Scale score that was deemed
			<lb/>
			acceptable, etc -all of which without doubt
			<lb/>
			impacted (at least to some extent) the
			<lb/>
			interpretation of the results.

			CONCLUSION
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Decompressive craniectomy is commonly
			<lb/>
			performed as an empiric lifesaving measure in
			<lb/>
			an attempt to protect the brain from the
			<lb/>
			damaging effects of propagating oedema and
			<lb/>
			intracranial hypertension <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref>. Improving
			<lb/>
			patient selection and optimising timing of the
			<lb/>
			procedure may be expected to further improve
			<lb/>
			outcome in severely brain injured patients. An
			<lb/>
			important way of achieving this is to have
			<lb/>
			clearly defined guidelines that may be applied
			<lb/>
			in every case for which the procedure is
			<lb/>
			envisaged. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows factors and
			<lb/>
			considerations in patient selection and timing
			<lb/>
			of decompressive craniectomy that have been
			<lb/>
			found to be important to patient outcome.
