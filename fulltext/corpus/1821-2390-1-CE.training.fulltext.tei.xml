		<head>Milk composition
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>
			Today, not only the nutritional value of milk but also other
			<lb/>
			physiological properties of milk components have attracted interest
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">(1)</ref>. Bovine milk contains approximately 87% water, 4.6% lactose,
			<lb/>
			3.4% protein, 4.2% fat, 0.8% minerals and 0.1% vitamins <ref type="biblio">(2)</ref>. The
			<lb/>
			composition of milk continuously undergoes changes depending on
			<lb/>
			e.g. breeding, feeding strategies, management of the cow, lactation
			<lb/>
			stage and season <ref type="biblio">(2-4)</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>Milk fat
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>The lipids in bovine milk are mainly present in globules as an oil-in-<lb/>water emulsion <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>. These fat
			droplets are formed by the
			<lb/>
			endoplasmic reticulum in the epithelial cells in the alveoli and
			<lb/>
			coated with a surface material of proteins and polar lipids. When
			<lb/>
			secreted, they are enveloped with the plasma membrane of the cell.
			<lb/>
			Membrane-associated materials can comprise 2-6% of the globule
			<lb/>
			mass <ref type="biblio">(6, 7)</ref>. The composition and structure of the milk fat globule
			<lb/>
			membrane (MFGM) is not known in detail but it is mainly composed
			<lb/>
			of polar lipids and membrane-bound and associated proteins. The
			<lb/>
			lipid fraction comprising approximately 30% of the membrane
			<lb/>
			material consists of lipids such as phospholipids (25%), cerebrosides
			<lb/>
			(3%) and cholesterol (2%). The remaining 70% of the membrane
			<lb/>
			material are proteins, many of them being enzymes <ref type="biblio">(8)</ref>. The milk fat
			<lb/>
			consists mainly of triglycerides, approximately 98%, while other
			<lb/>
			milk lipids are diacylglycerol (about 2% of the lipid fraction),
			<lb/>
			cholesterol (less than 0.5%), phospholipids (about 1%) and free fatty
			<lb/>
			acids (FFA) (about 0.1) <ref type="biblio">(9)</ref>. In addition, there are trace amounts of
			<lb/>
			ether lipids, hydrocarbons, fat-soluble vitamins, favour compounds
			<lb/>
			and compounds introduced by the feed <ref type="biblio">(10)</ref>. The size of the milk fat
			<lb/>
			globule increases with increasing fat content in the milk probably
			<lb/>
			because of a limitation in production of MFGM <ref type="biblio">(11)</ref>. The number of
			<lb/>
			milk fat globules (MFG) in milk is approximately 10 10 per mL with a
			<lb/>
			total area of 700 cm 2 per mL of milk <ref type="biblio">(4)</ref>. The size of the MFG has
			<lb/>
			crucial infuence on the stability and technological properties of
			<lb/>
			milk. Milk lipid globules are resistant to pancreatic lipolysis in the
			<lb/>
			small intestine unless they are frst exposed to gastric lipolysis <ref type="biblio">(12)</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>Origin of milk fatty acids
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>The milk fatty acids are derived almost equally from two sources,
			<lb/>
			the feed and the microbial activity in the rumen of the cow <ref type="biblio">(10)</ref>. The
			<lb/>
			fatty acid synthesising system in the mammary gland of the cow
			<lb/>
			produces fatty acids with even number of carbons of 4 to 16 carbons
			<lb/>
			in length and accounts for approximately 60% and 45% of the fatty
			<lb/>
			acids on a molar and weight basis, respectively <ref type="biblio">(13)</ref>. This de novo
			<lb/>
			synthesis in the mammary gland is of the 4:0 to 14:0 acids together
			<lb/>
			with about half of the 16:0 from acetate and -hydroxybutyrate.
			<lb/>
			Acetate and butyric acid are generated in the rumen by
			<lb/>
			fermentation of feed components. The butyric acid is converted to -<lb/>hydroxybutyrate during absorption
			through the rumen epithelium.
			<lb/>
			Bovine fat contains certain fatty acids with odd number of carbons,
			<lb/>
			such as pentadecanoic acid (15:0) and heptadecanoic acid (17:0).
			<lb/>
			These two fatty acids are synthesised by the bacterial fora in the
			<lb/>
			rumen <ref type="biblio">(14)</ref>. The remaining 16:0 and the long-chain fatty acids
			<lb/>
			originate from dietary lipids and from lipolysis of adipose tissue
			<lb/>
			triacylglycerols <ref type="biblio">(10)</ref>. Medium-and long-chain fatty acids, but mainly
			<lb/>
			18:0, may be desaturated in the mammary gland to form the
			<lb/>
			corresponding monosaturated acids.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatty acids are not randomly esterifed at the 3 positions of the
			<lb/>
			triacylglycerol molecule <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>. The short-chain acids butyric (4:0) and
			<lb/>
			caproic (6:0) are esterifed almost entirely at sn-3. Medium-chain
			<lb/>
			fatty acids (8:0-14:0) as well as 16:0 are preferentially esterifed at
			<lb/>
			positions sn-1 and sn-2. Steric acid (18:0) is selectively placed at
			<lb/>
			position sn-1 whereas 18:1 shows preference for positions sn-1 and
			<lb/>
			sn-3.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		<p>
			When consumed by humans, milk triacylglycerols are lipolysed by
			<lb/>
			lingual lipases in the mouth and by both lingual and gastric lipase in
			<lb/>
			the stomach <ref type="biblio">(10)</ref>. The lipases preferentially hydrolyse sn-3 position
			<lb/>
			fatty acids, and therefore selectively releases the shorter acids. The
			<lb/>
			result is that 4:0 to 10:0 pass through the stomach wall in
			<lb/>
			decreasing quantities as the molecular weight increases, enter the
			<lb/>
			portal vein, and are transported to the liver where they are oxidised.
			<lb/>
			About 25 to 40% of the triacylglycerols are digested in the stomach
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">(15)</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>Fatty acid composition
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Milk fat triacylglycerols are synthesised from more than 400
			<lb/>
			diferent fatty acids, which makes milk fat the most complex of all
			<lb/>
			natural fats <ref type="biblio">(9, 10, 15)</ref>. Nearly all of these acids are present in trace
			<lb/>
			quantities and only about 15 acids at the 1% level or higher. Many
			<lb/>
			factors are associated with the variations in the amount and fatty
			<lb/>
			acid composition of bovine milk lipids (<ref type="biblio">15, 16)</ref>. They may be of
			<lb/>
			animal origin, i.e., related to genetics (breed and selection), stage of
			<lb/>
			lactation, mastitis and ruminal fermentation, or they may be feed-<lb/>related factors, i.e., related to
			fbre and energy intake, dietary fats,
			<lb/>
			and seasonal and regional efects. The gross composition of milk fat
			<lb/>
			in Swedish dairy milk 2001 was 69.4% saturated fatty acids and
			<lb/>
			30.6% unsaturated fatty acids (<ref type="biblio">Lindmark-Månsson, 2001</ref>). The
			<lb/>
			content of saturated fatty acids is lowest in the summer when the
			<lb/>
			cows are grazing, and highest in the winter due to indoor feeding.
			<lb/>
			The content of the unsaturated fatty acids shows the opposite
			<lb/>
			pattern with the highest amount in the summer. The fatty acid
			<lb/>
			composition of Swedish milk fat is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The saturated fatty acids present in milk accounts for approximately
			<lb/>
			70% by weight <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>. The most important fatty acid from a quantitative
			<lb/>
			viewpoint is palmitic acid (16:0), which accounts for approximately
			<lb/>
			30% by weight of the total fatty acids. Myristic acid (14:0) and
			<lb/>
			stearic acid (18:0) make up 11 and 12% by weight, respectively. Of
			<lb/>
			the saturated fatty acids, 10.9 % are short-chain fatty acids (C4:0 to
			<lb/>
			C10:0). The amounts of butyric acid (4:0) and caproic acid (6:0) on a
			<lb/>
			yearly average are 4.4 and 2.4% by weight of the total fatty acids,
			<lb/>
			respectively, in Swedish dairy milk <ref type="biblio">(2)</ref>. These amounts are higher
			<lb/>
			when their proportions are expressed as molar percentages,
			<lb/>
			approximately 10 and 5%, respectively <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>.
			<lb/>
			Approximately 25% of the fatty acids in milk are mono-unsaturated
			<lb/>
			with oleic acid (18:1) accounting for 23.8% by weight of the total
			<lb/>
			fatty acids in Swedish dairy milk. Poly-unsaturated fatty acids
			<lb/>
			constitute about 2.3% by weight of the total fatty acids and the main
			<lb/>
			poly-unsaturated fatty acids are linoleic acid (18:2 ) and -linolenic
			<lb/>
			acid (18:3) accounting for 1.6 and 0.7% by weight of the total fatty
			<lb/>
			acids. The ratio between omega-6 and omega-3-fatty acids in
			<lb/>
			Swedish milk fat was 2.3:1 in 2001 <ref type="biblio">(2)</ref>. Milk and meat from
			<lb/>
			ruminants can be an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in the
			<lb/>
			human diet, as is the case in France, where animal products account
			<lb/>
			for about 40% of the intake <ref type="biblio">(17)</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Approximately 2.7% of the fatty acids in milk are trans fatty acids with one
			<lb/>
			or more trans-double bonds <ref type="biblio">(18)</ref>. The main trans 18:1 isomer is vaccenic
			<lb/>
			acid (VA), (18:1, 11t), but trans double bounds in position 4 to 16 is also
			<lb/>
			observed in low concentrations in milk fat <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>. VA constitutes
			<lb/>
			approximately 2.7% of the total fatty acid content and varies with season.
			<lb/>
			Milk fat contains also conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), with many different
			<lb/>
			isomers including rumenic acid (RA) (cis-9, trans-11 CLA) which
			<lb/>
			predominates (75-90% of total CLA) <ref type="biblio">(18)</ref>. The majority of RA in the milk
			<lb/>
			fat is synthesised endogenously, in the mammary gland through the action
			<lb/>
			of mammary -desaturase on VA <ref type="biblio">(19)</ref>. Thus both VA and RA are present in
			<lb/>
			milk and dairy products, generally in the ration of about 1:3 <ref type="biblio">(20)</ref>. VA has a
			<lb/>
			double role in metabolism because it is both a trans fatty acid and a
			<lb/>
			precursor for 9c,11t-CLA. A small amount of the CLA originates from
			<lb/>
			biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids by rumen bacteria. Animal
			<lb/>
			studies and new human data have confirmed the bioconversion of VA into
			<lb/>
			CLA <ref type="biblio">(21, 22)</ref>. Bovine milk, milk products and bovine meat are the main
			<lb/>
			dietary sources of the RA <ref type="biblio">(23)</ref>. Milk content of 9c,11t-CLA varies
			<lb/>
			considerably, but in Swedish milk fat it constitutes about 0.4% of the fat
			<lb/>
			fraction.
