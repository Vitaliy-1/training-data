		<head>INTRODUCTION
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Sleepwalking (somnambulism) is one of the
			<lb/>
			sleep disorders known as the parasomnias,
			<lb/>
			which are not disorders of the processes
			<lb/>
			responsible for sleep but undesirable
			<lb/>
			phenomena that occur predominantly during
			<lb/>
			sleep. Sleepwalking consists of a series of
			<lb/>
			complex behaviours that are initiated during
			<lb/>
			slow-wave sleep and result in walking during
			<lb/>
			sleep <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. It appears in the context of a non-<lb/>rapid
			<lb/>
			eye
			<lb/>
			movement (NREM)
			<lb/>
			sleep.
			<lb/>
			Sleepwalking is called a &quot;disorder of arousal&quot;<lb/>
			because it most often occurs following sudden
			<lb/>
			arousal from deep sleep.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Episodes of sleepwalking vary in complexity
			<lb/>
			and can range from simple activities such as
			<lb/>
			sitting up in bed to walking and even to violent
			<lb/>
			acts. The patient may be difficult to awaken
			<lb/>
			and when awakened, is usually confused. The
			<lb/>
			patient usually does not remember the events.
			<lb/>
			Sleepwalking occurs during slow-wave sleep
			<lb/>
			and so is most often evident during the first
			<lb/>
			third of the night or during other times of
			<lb/>
			increased slow-wave activity, such as after
			<lb/>
			sleep deprivation <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. Homicide or suicide
			<lb/>
			during a sleepwalking episode has been
			<lb/>
			reported <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. The person attempting to awaken
			<lb/>
			the patient may be physically attacked <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Sleepwalking and night terrors are considered
			<lb/>
			manifestations of the same nosologic
			<lb/>
			continuum. Both are thought to be due to
			<lb/>
			sudden arousal from non-REM sleep <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			Prevalence rates of these conditions are
			<lb/>
			based
			<lb/>
			on
			<lb/>
			self-reported
			<lb/>
			data
			<lb/>
			and,
			<lb/>
			consequently, are likely to be underestimated
			<lb/>
			<ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The causes of sleepwalking are incompletely
			<lb/>
			understood. Genetic factors are said to be
			<lb/>
			important in the aetiology of the disorder
			<lb/>
			because the prevalence of sleepwalking in
			<lb/>
			first-degree relatives of an affected individual
			<lb/>
			is at least tenfold greater than in the general
			<lb/>
			population <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. Family history is very important,
			<lb/>
			because the prevalence in children increases
			<lb/>
			to 45% if one of the parents is affected and to
			<lb/>
			60% if both parents are affected. Twin studies
			<lb/>
			too provided support for a possible genetic
			<lb/>
			origin of sleepwalking: the concordance rate in
			<lb/>
			monozygotic twins is 55% compared with 35%
			<lb/>
			in dizygotic twins <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			Sleepwalking also occurs in Parkinson&apos;s
			<lb/>
			disease <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>, hyperthyroidism <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>, migraine
			<ref type="biblio">[8]
				<lb/>
			</ref>
			and following the use of quetiapine <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> or
			<lb/>
			olanzapine <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. Diagnosing sleepwalking with
			<lb/>
			objective instruments is difficult because
			<lb/>
			episodes rarely occur in the laboratory.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>However, evidence suggests that sleepwalkers
			<lb/>
			experience a substantial increase in the mean
			<lb/>
			frequency
			<lb/>
			of
			<lb/>
			somnambulistic
			<lb/>
			episodes
			<lb/>
			following sleep deprivation <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. Certain
			<lb/>
			studies suggested an association between
			<lb/>
			adult sleepwalking and mental disorders, as
			<lb/>
			well as between adult sleepwalking and
			<lb/>
			psychotropic medications <ref type="biblio">[12,13]</ref>.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The management of sleepwalking relies on
			<lb/>
			safety precautions and drugs <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. Safety
			<lb/>
			measures include ensuring that the patient
			<lb/>
			lives on the ground floor of a house,
			<lb/>
			dangerous materials are removed from the
			<lb/>
			room, and glass windows are covered with
			<lb/>
			thick drapes. Effective drugs include diazepam
			<lb/>
			and other benzodiazepines, as well as the
			<lb/>
			tricyclic antidepressants.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Although the prevalence of sleepwalking has
			<lb/>
			been documented in certain parts of the world,
			<lb/>
			there is not enough information on its
			<lb/>
			prevalence and demographic correlates in
			<lb/>
			Nigeria. This study was aimed at determining
			<lb/>
			the lifetime prevalence and demographic
			<lb/>
			correlates of sleepwalking in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>MATERIALS AND METHODS
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>The study was carried out in the Obafemi
			<lb/>
			Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals
			<lb/>
			Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, in Southwestern
			<lb/>
			Nigeria. The study was approved by the Ethics
			<lb/>
			and Research Committee of the Obafemi
			<lb/>
			Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals
			<lb/>
			Complex. All participants gave written
			<lb/>
			informed consent.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Ile-Ife is a rapidly growing city in which a
			<lb/>
			federal
			<lb/>
			university
			<lb/>
			(Obafemi
			<lb/>
			Awolowo
			<lb/>
			University) and a teaching hospital (Obafemi
			<lb/>
			Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals
			<lb/>
			Complex; OAUTHC) are located. Thus, though
			<lb/>
			the city is in the Yoruba-speaking part of
			<lb/>
			Nigeria, it is home to people from different
			<lb/>
			ethnic groups, many of whom were attracted
			<lb/>
			by the educational, medical, commercial,
			<lb/>
			farming and other activities.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The city of Ile-Ife is composed of two local
			<lb/>
			government areas (LGA), each with ten
			<lb/>
			smaller districts referred to as &apos;wards&apos;. In each
			<lb/>
			street or road within a district, one person was
			<lb/>
			approached in every third building (house,
			<lb/>
			shop or office). Some people refused to
			<lb/>
			participate and some were excluded because
			<lb/>
			they did not understand the questionnaire.
			<lb/>
			Those under the age of 18 years or above the
			<lb/>
			age of 60 years were also excluded. Some
			<lb/>
			others were excluded because of ill health.
			<lb/>
			People who had a history of seizure, loss of
			<lb/>
			consciousness or stroke were excluded from
			<lb/>
			the study. Twelve (and in some cases 13)
			<lb/>
			participants were recruited from each district,
			<lb/>
			giving a total of 250 people. All gave their
			<lb/>
			consent.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Five assistants distributed the questionnaire,
			<lb/>
			while the author coordinated and oversaw the
			<lb/>
			whole exercise. Each of the assistants worked
			<lb/>
			in two districts within each local government
			<lb/>
			area. Copies of the questionnaires were
			<lb/>
			distributed in the first local government area on
			<lb/>
			Saturday, 16 th August 2008, and in the second
			<lb/>
			area on Saturday, 23 rd August 2008.
			<lb/>
			Weekends were chosen for the distribution of
			<lb/>
			the questionnaire because they were
			<lb/>
			considered the most convenient periods for the
			<lb/>
			respondents. The questionnaires were
			<lb/>
			distributed between 08:00 and 16:00 hours,
			<lb/>
			and the participants were allowed 24 hours to
			<lb/>
			consult their spouses, bed partners and
			<lb/>
			relatives, after which the completed forms
			<lb/>
			were collected.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>All participants were resident in Ile-Ife. They
			<lb/>
			were of different ethnic groups and social
			<lb/>
			classes and all were literate enough in English
			<lb/>
			to be able to understand the description of
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking. Due to the complex nature of the
			<lb/>
			description of sleepwalking, the questionnaire
			<lb/>
			was not translated into local languages.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The questionnaire elicited information on age,
			<lb/>
			sex, marital status, level of education and the
			<lb/>
			lifetime prevalence rate of sleepwalking. They
			<lb/>
			were required to indicate whether they had
			<lb/>
			ever experienced sleepwalking in their lifetime.
			<lb/>
			Since people generally do not recall
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking episodes, participants were
			<lb/>
			urged to verify from their spouses or bed
			<lb/>
			partners and other close family members with
			<lb/>
			whom they may have lived. The questionnaire
			<lb/>
			is reproduced in Annex 1.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The data were analysed statistically to obtain
			<lb/>
			the socio-demographic characteristics of the
			<lb/>
			subjects. The number and percentage of those
			<lb/>
			who experienced sleepwalking were
			<lb/>
			calculated. Significance of differences were
			<lb/>
			evaluated with Chi-square test, specifying p &lt;<lb/>
			0.05 as significant.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>
			RESULTS
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>Of the 250 participants, 18 did not return the
			<lb/>
			questionnaire and four were not sure if they
			<lb/>
			had experienced sleepwalking, which left 228
			<lb/>
			participants: 115 males and 113 females,
			<lb/>
			overall ranging in age from 18 to 60 years with
			<lb/>
			a mean of 46.3 years and standard deviation
			<lb/>
			of 11.6 years. The information on marital
			<lb/>
			status and educational level are shown in
			<lb/>
			<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

		<p>Sixteen of the 228 participants (7.0%) reported
			<lb/>
			having experienced sleepwalking. Twelve of
			<lb/>
			the 115 males (10.4%) and four of the 113
			<lb/>
			females (3.5%) reported sleepwalking, but the
			<lb/>
			difference was not statistically significant (X² =
			<lb/>
			3.163, df = 1, p = 0.07). Twelve of the 16
			<lb/>
			individuals who had experienced sleepwalking
			<lb/>
			(75%) were within the age range of 18-30
			<lb/>
			years. Five of the 16 (31.25%) were single
			<lb/>
			while 11 (68.75%) were married (X² = 0.041, df
			<lb/>
			1, p = 0.84). Two of them (12.5%) had primary
			<lb/>
			education, six (37.5%) had secondary
			<lb/>
			education and eight (50%) had post secondary
			<lb/>
			education (X² = 2.436, df = 2, p = 0.296).
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<head>DISCUSSION
			<lb/>
		</head>
		
		<p>The results show that sleepwalking is much
			<lb/>
			commoner than was once thought, with 7% of
			<lb/>
			the participants reporting having experienced
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking. Previous studies have reported
			<lb/>
			much lower prevalence rates ranging from 2%
			<lb/>
			to 3.9% <ref type="biblio">[6,15,16]</ref>. However, the observations
			<lb/>
			are consistent with the 1-15% range given by
			<lb/>
			the American Academy of Sleep Medicine <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>.
			<lb/>
			The preponderance of males in this study
			<lb/>
			(75%) is consistent with previous findings
			<ref type="biblio">[17-<lb/>20]
			</ref>
			.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>The importance of sleepwalking in clinical
			<lb/>
			practice cannot be overemphasised. During
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking, the individual is in a state of
			<lb/>
			partial arousal from early non-REM sleep,
			<lb/>
			during which some areas of the brain appear
			<lb/>
			to be functioning as in a waking state while
			<lb/>
			other areas appear to remain in a state of
			<lb/>
			sleep. During an episode of sleepwalking, the
			<lb/>
			individual is at risk of sustaining physical
			<lb/>
			injuries. The fact that the individual does not
			<lb/>
			retain the memory of the event makes the
			<lb/>
			experience psychologically very disturbing.
			<lb/>
			This makes sleepwalking not just a sleep
			<lb/>
			disorder but also a psychological challenge.
			<lb/>
			Cases of violence carried out during
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking have been reported in the
			<lb/>
			forensic literature <ref type="biblio">[3,21,22]</ref>. During the trial of
			<lb/>
			such cases, the idea that it is possible to
			<lb/>
			engage in dangerous behaviour while
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking may be met with a great deal of
			<lb/>
			scepticism.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>Sleepwalking can have grave physical,
			<lb/>
			psychological and forensic consequences.
			<lb/>
			Clinicians evaluating cases of seizure
			<lb/>
			disorders should be encouraged to include
			<lb/>
			questions concerning behavioural arousal from
			<lb/>
			the first hours of sleep without awareness or
			<lb/>
			recall of the events. There should be a
			<lb/>
			standard procedure to exclude the differential
			<lb/>
			diagnoses of sleepwalking, such as complex
			<lb/>
			partial seizures, toxic encephalopathy and
			<lb/>
			other causes of delirium, and also from REM
			<lb/>
			sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. REM
			<lb/>
			sleep behaviour disorder is a dream-enacting
			<lb/>
			disorder with complex and aggressive
			<lb/>
			behaviour emerging during REM sleep with
			<lb/>
			loss of the usual muscle paralysis of REM
			<lb/>
			sleep. Because sleepwalking has also been
			<lb/>
			reported in Parkinson&apos;s disease <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>,
			<lb/>
			hyperthyroidism <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> and migraine <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>, patients
			<lb/>
			suffering from these conditions should be
			<lb/>
			properly evaluated for possible occurrence of
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking. These measures will facilitate
			<lb/>
			early detection and prompt management of
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>An obvious limitation of this study is the rather
			<lb/>
			small sample size. Another limitation is that the
			<lb/>
			questionnaire was not translated into local
			<lb/>
			languages; thus only those who were literate in
			<lb/>
			English took part. However, the idea was to
			<lb/>
			ensure that the participants understand the
			<lb/>
			instructions, and at present there are no
			<lb/>
			validated translations of the complex
			<lb/>
			descriptions of sleepwalking in the local
			<lb/>
			languages.
			<lb/>
		</p>
		
		<p>In conclusion, this study provides preliminary
			<lb/>
			data on sleepwalking in the studied population.
			<lb/>
			The high prevalence of sleepwalking and its
			<lb/>
			male preponderance are noteworthy. Further
			<lb/>
			studies on a much larger scale are needed to
			<lb/>
			provide more information. Such studies should
			<lb/>
			be extended to identify the physical,
			<lb/>
			psychological and legal consequences of
			<lb/>
			sleepwalking.

			PART 2
			<lb/>
			This questionnaire aims at obtaining information about sleepwalking which is one of the sleep
			<lb/>
			disorders. Sleepwalking consists of a series of behaviors that occur during sleep and may range from
			<lb/>
			such behaviours as the individual sitting up in bed, walking about, to a display of aggression and
			<lb/>
			violence. Such an individual may have caused injuries either to himself/herself, to others or to both
			<lb/>
			himself and others. The individual may be difficult to awaken but, when awakened, often is mentally
			<lb/>
			confused. The individual usually does not remember the event and depends largely on the account of
			<lb/>
			witnesses such as bed partners. It is thus suggested to the participants in this study to please find out
			<lb/>
			from their spouses/ bed partners and relatives if this has happened to them (the participants) at least
			<lb/>
			once in their lifetime before indicating whether they have experienced sleepwalking or not. Injuries (if
			<lb/>
			any) that resulted from such experiences are not part of the current study. INDIVIDUALS KNOWN TO
			<lb/>
			BE SUFFERING FROM SEIZURE DISORDER, STROKE OR WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LOSS
			<lb/>
			OF CONSCIOUSNESS MAY NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY.
			<lb/>
			Have you ever experienced sleepwalking in your life? Yes
			<lb/>
			No
			<lb/>
			Thanks for your participation.
